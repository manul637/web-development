     <p>

        I met an traveller from an antique land , <br>
        Who said- " Two trunkless legs of stone " <br>
        Stand in the desert .... near then on the sand , <br>
        Half sun a shattered visage lies, whose frown , <br>
        and wrinkled lip , and sneer of cold command, <br>
        Tell that its sculptor well those passions reads <br>
